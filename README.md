# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
in this project, I used python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States Chicago, New York City, and Washington.<br>

I wrote a code to answer data questions such as:<br>
1) Popular times of travel <br>
- most common month<br>
- most common day of week<br>
- most common hour of day<br>

2) Popular stations and trip<br>
- most common start station<br>
- most common end station<br>
- most common trip from start to end<br>

3) Trip duration<br>
- total travel time<br>
- average travel time<br>

4) User info<br>
- counts of each user type<br>
- counts of each gender<br>
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth<br>

and I answered those intriguing questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.<br>
